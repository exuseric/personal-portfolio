            <h2>I've been building on the web for <em>half a decade<sup>*</sup></em>, and in that time, I've learned what makes a great site tick.</h2>
        </article>
        <p>My background blends development, UI/UX design, and a solid dash of brandingâ€”from building polished storefronts in Shopify to deploying lightning-fast landing pages with Astro and Pocketbase.</p>
        <p>I've worked solo, in teams, and alongside agencies. I'm comfortable diving into performance audits, biannual design refreshes, or sprinting toward a product launch. No matter the project, I bring clean code, smart design decisions, and a sense of calm when things get hectic.</p>
